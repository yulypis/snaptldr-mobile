# âœ… AdMob Setup Complete!

Your SnapTLDR Android app is now configured with your live AdMob IDs:

## Configured AdMob IDs

- âœ… Set in `android/app/build.gradle`
- âœ… Will be used for AdMob initialization

### Banner Ad Unit: `ca-app-pub-7897688814607325/1606161831`
- âœ… Set in `App.tsx`
- âœ… Shows permanently at top of app

### Interstitial Ad Unit: `ca-app-pub-7897688814607325/4040753488`

## Production vs Development Behavior

### In Development (__DEV__ = true):
- Uses AdMob test IDs to prevent policy violations
- Test ads will show during development/testing

### In Production (__DEV__ = false):
- Uses your real AdMob IDs above
- Real ads will show and generate revenue

## Next Steps for Launch

1. **Build Release APK**:
   ```bash
   cd mobile
   npm install
   cd android
   ./gradlew bundleRelease
   ```

2. **Upload to Play Store**:
   - Use `android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`
   - Complete store listing with screenshots
   - Submit for review (2-3 days)

3. **Revenue Tracking**:
   - Monitor earnings in your AdMob dashboard
   - Track app analytics in Google Play Console
   - PayPal payments continue working through WebView

## Expected Revenue

With your AdMob configuration:
- **Banner ads**: $1-3 CPM (constant visibility)
- **Interstitial ads**: $3-7 CPM (every 3rd usage)
- **Combined**: $50-150/month per 1,000 daily users

Plus your existing PayPal revenue from the web app!

## Your Android App is Ready for Production! ðŸš€

All AdMob IDs are properly configured. The app will use test ads during development and your real ads in production builds.
